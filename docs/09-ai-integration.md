# AI Integration

## AI Models Used

We leveraged several AI models to assist in the development and documentation of this project, with Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet being the primary ones used. LLMs have been used for:

- Initial documentation drafting and refinement
- Structuring and organizing technical content
- Generating clear and concise explanations
- YAML configuration generation
- Modifying existing deployment files to be compatible with kwok
- Optimizing configuration parameters
- Providing suggestions for best practices in Kubernetes configurations

The AI models were particularly helpful in converting standard Kubernetes configurations to kwok-compatible formats, generating initial deployment manifests, polishing technical documentation, and ensuring consistency across configuration files.
