# Solution Architecture

## System Overview

The solution architecture is designed to provide a comprehensive observability platform for large-scale Kubernetes clusters using KWOK for simulation. The architecture consists of several key components working together to collect, process, store, and visualize telemetry data.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Simulation Layer
- **KWOK Cluster**
  - Simulated Kubernetes nodes
  - Virtual pods and workloads
  - Control plane components

### 2. Data Collection Layer
- **OpenTelemetry Collector**
  - Receivers for different telemetry types
  - Processors for data transformation
  - Exporters for backend systems

### 3. Storage Layer
- **Metrics Storage**
  - Prometheus for time-series metrics
  - Long-term storage solutions

- **Logs Storage**
  - Loki or Elasticsearch/OpenSearch
  - Log aggregation and indexing

- **Traces Storage**
  - Jaeger for distributed tracing
  - Trace sampling and storage

### 4. Visualization Layer
- **Grafana**
  - Dashboard management
  - Data visualization
  - Alerting and notifications

## Data Flow

1. **Data Generation**
   - KWOK simulates node and pod activities
   - Telemetry data is generated at scale

2. **Data Collection**
   - OpenTelemetry agents collect telemetry
   - Data is processed and normalized

3. **Data Storage**
   - Processed data is stored in appropriate backends
   - Data retention policies are applied

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Grafana queries the storage backends
   - Dashboards display the collected data

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling of collectors
- Distributed storage systems
- Query optimization
- Data sampling strategies

## Security Considerations

- Authentication and authorization
- Data encryption
- Network security
- Access control

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- System health monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Resource utilization
- Alert management
