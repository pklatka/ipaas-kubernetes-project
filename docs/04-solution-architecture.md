# Solution Architecture

The solution architecture is designed to provide a comprehensive observability platform for large-scale Kubernetes clusters using KWOK for simulation. The architecture consists of several key components working together to collect, process, store, and visualize telemetry data.

## Architecture Components

### Docker
Docker serves as the foundational containerization platform for all components within this architecture. Since Kubernetes itself is a container orchestration tool, using Docker as the underlying runtime provides a consistent and portable environment for deploying KWOK, the observability stack, and any simulated agents.

### KWOK
KWOK (Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet) and its associated CLI tool, kwokctl, are central to simulating a large-scale Kubernetes cluster. kwokctl will be used to deploy a KWOK cluster that creates thousands of virtual nodes and pods as Docker containers. This simulation generates the realistic scale necessary to test the observability stack without the significant resource overhead of actual Kubelets or container runtimes. KWOK also configures kubectl to interact seamlessly with this simulated cluster.

### Kubectl
kubectl is the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. In this architecture, it will be used to manage the KWOK-simulated cluster, allowing for inspection of simulated nodes and pods, deployment of observability agents (if necessary), and verification of the cluster's state.

### Observability Stack
The observability stack is composed of well-established open-source tools, integrated to provide comprehensive monitoring, and tracing capabilities.

#### Prometheus
Prometheus will be deployed within or alongside the KWOK-simulated environment to scrape metrics generated by the Kubernetes control plane and simulated metrics created by kwok tool. We will leverage default integrations and configurations provided by kwokctl to ensure proper data collection.

#### Jaeger
Jaeger will be used for distributed tracing. While KWOK doesn't execute actual application workloads, mechanisms will be explored to generate simulated trace data from the KWOK-managed objects or through simulated pods, which Jaeger will then collect and store. Similar to Prometheus, we'll aim to utilize default configurations and images integrated with kwokctl.

#### Grafana
Grafana acts as the unified visualization layer for all collected telemetry data. It will connect to Prometheus and Jaeger as data sources, enabling the creation of dashboards to monitor the simulated cluster's health, component performance, and the observability stack's efficiency. Default images and configurations integrated with kwokctl will be utilized to streamline deployment.

### Automation and Testing
Bash scripts and YAML configuration files are crucial for automating the deployment, configuration, and testing processes. These scripts will manage the kwokctl commands for cluster setup, deploy the observability stack components, configure data sources in Grafana, and execute automated tests to generate high-volume telemetry and measure system performance. This programmatic approach ensures reproducibility and allows for iterative testing and refinement of the observability strategy. Additionaly we will leverage docker to create lightly customized images for our purposes.
