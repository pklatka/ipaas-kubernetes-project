# Introduction

Managing and observing large-scale Kubernetes clusters presents significant challenges due to the immense volume of data generated by thousands of nodes and pods. This data often overwhelms traditional observability tools and hinders effective monitoring, logging, and tracing crucial for maintaining cluster health and performance.

Furthermore, the difficulty and cost associated with replicating such large environments for testing exacerbate these issues, limiting the ability to validate and refine observability strategies under realistic conditions.

This project proposes to leverage KWOK (Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet), a toolkit capable of simulating thousands of Kubernetes nodes with minimal resources, as a means to overcome these limitations. By providing a scalable and cost-effective environment to test and evaluate observability solutions, we aim to improve the understanding, performance, and reliability of large-scale cluster observability.
