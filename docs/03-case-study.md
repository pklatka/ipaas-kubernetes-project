# Case Study

## Overview

This project will undertake a primary case study focused on demonstrating and evaluating the scalability and performance of a cloud-native observability stack under high-volume telemetry load generated by a simulated large-scale Kubernetes cluster.

## Core Concept

The central concept is to leverage KWOK to instantiate an environment representing thousands of Kubernetes nodes and a significant multitude of pods. This simulated scale allows for the generation of a volume and velocity of metrics, logs, and traces that are characteristic of real-world large clusters, which are typically challenging and costly to replicate for testing purposes.

## Implementation Approach

Within this KWOK-simulated environment, we will deploy and configure:

1. A comprehensive observability stack featuring:
 - Prometheus for metrics
 - Grafana for visualization
 - Jaeger for traces

2. The simulated nodes and pods (or simple agents/applications) will be configured to produce telemetry data at a rate and volume commensurate with the large cluster size.

## Objectives

The core objective of this case study is to systematically push the installed observability stack to its limits within this controlled, scaled environment. We will measure and analyze:

1. **Observability Performance**
   - The ingestion rate of the observability backend components
   - Resource consumption when processing high volumes of data
   - Performance with thousands of data sources

2. **Architecture Performance**
   - Latency and reliability of kubernetes components like etcd
   - Performance with extremaly high node and pod count
   - Resouce usage under extreme conditions

## Expected Outcomes

By executing this focused case study, the project aims to provide concrete evidence and insights into the practical challenges of large-scale observability and demonstrate how a KWOK-based simulation environment is an invaluable tool for testing, validating, and optimizing the performance and configuration of observability solutions before deploying them in expensive, large-scale production environments.
