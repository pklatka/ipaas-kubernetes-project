# Case Study

## Overview

This project will undertake a primary case study focused on demonstrating and evaluating the scalability and performance of a cloud-native observability stack under high-volume telemetry load generated by a simulated large-scale Kubernetes cluster.

## Core Concept

The central concept is to leverage KWOK to instantiate an environment representing thousands of Kubernetes nodes and a significant multitude of pods. This simulated scale allows for the generation of a volume and velocity of metrics, logs, and traces that are characteristic of real-world large clusters, which are typically challenging and costly to replicate for testing purposes.

## Implementation Approach

Within this KWOK-simulated environment, we will deploy and configure:

1. A comprehensive observability stack featuring:
   - OpenTelemetry for data collection (metrics, logs, traces)
   - Suitable storage systems:
     - Prometheus for metrics
     - Loki or Elasticsearch/OpenSearch for logs
     - Jaeger for traces
   - Grafana for visualization

2. The simulated nodes and pods (or simple agents/applications) will be configured to produce telemetry data at a rate and volume commensurate with the large cluster size.

## Objectives

The core objective of this case study is to systematically push the installed observability stack to its limits within this controlled, scaled environment. We will measure and analyze:

1. **Ingestion Performance**
   - The ingestion rate of the observability backend components
   - Resource consumption when processing high volumes of data
   - Performance with thousands of data sources

2. **Query Performance**
   - Latency and reliability of querying in Grafana
   - Dashboard loading times with large time ranges
   - Performance with high-cardinality data

3. **Collection Efficiency**
   - Effectiveness of OpenTelemetry configuration
   - Data collection without system overload
   - Critical information preservation

4. **System Analysis**
   - Identification of potential bottlenecks
   - Configuration challenges at scale
   - Optimization opportunities

## Expected Outcomes

By executing this focused case study, the project aims to:

1. Provide concrete evidence of large-scale observability challenges
2. Demonstrate KWOK's value as a simulation tool
3. Enable testing and validation of observability solutions
4. Optimize performance and configuration before production deployment
